  Matrix-calculation module
</h1>

> A simple matrix-calculation module for your matrix-calculations. [whats a matrix?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix)

## Features
--> Info: This project is an interesting school-exercise which implements a custom matrix-module with certain funktions and a simple test-class :)

**Elements:**
- The matrix-module with header
- A makefile
- A test-module

**Funktions:**
- madd (adds two matrixes together)
- msub (subtracts two matrixes)
- mskal (scale a matrix(multiplicate every element with a val_t which is a double))
- mprod (multiplicate two matrixes)

**In Future:**
- Idk, I'd be already happy if it worked (2)...

## How to use

To compile this program I'd recommend to use a linux distro with [gcc](https://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/), but you can also use [MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) for windows or an IDE like Vim/Emacs or VCS for Windows and MacOS.
The rule to compile the test-program is in the makefile.
